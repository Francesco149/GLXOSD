Description: Overlay that displays FPS and CPU/GPU temperature in OpenGL applications.
 GLXOSD is a basic OSD that works by intercepting glXSwapBuffers calls, inspired
 from RivaTuner OSD on Windows. It can display the number of frames per second,
 the temperature of CPUs and the temperature of NVIDIA GPUs.
 This package provides the launcher.
