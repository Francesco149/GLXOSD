h2#general-usage General usage

p.
    To use GLXOSD you'll need to launch the application you want it to display in using the <code>glxosd</code> command. All you have to do is prefix the command you use to launch the application with <code>glxosd </code>. For example, if you want to launch glxgears, you will have to run this:
pre.
    glxosd glxgears

p.
    And if you want to run Minecraft, you'll have to run this:
pre.
    glxosd java -jar Minecraft.jar

p.
    To remove the need of launching the application through the terminal, you should just edit the launcher for that application to include GLXOSD in the command.

h2#turn-on-off Turning the OSD off and on

p.
    The default shortcut for turning the GLXOSD on and off is <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd>. You can change this in the configuration.

h2#benchmarking Benchmarking

p.
    The default shortcut for starting and stopping GLXOSD frame logging is <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F9</kbd>. The default output location for GLXOSD frame timing logs is <code>/tmp/</code>. Both of these options can be configured in the configuration scripts.

p.
    When logging starts, a file for each context will be created in the output directory and, by default, the OSD will be hidden to remove the overhead of rendering it.

p.
    Each file starts with <code># GLXOSD frame log version (version)</code>

p.
    To make benchmarking more fair, please put the output directory on a fast filesystem.
