h2#other-distros Other distributions

p.
    At the moment, there are no official packages for other distributions. If you would like to maintain GLXOSD packages for your favourite distribution, please consult the documentation.

h2#source Compile from source

p.
    Before compiling, please make sure the following libraries are installed and are available to CMake: FontConfig, Freetype, GLU, GLEW.

p.
    You should also have git, CMake, and GCC installed.

p.
    It is recommended that you use chroots to build GLXOSD. It is also recommended that you build both amd64 and i386 binaries because a lot of games are 32 bit applications. Since the instructions are distro-specific, the instructions for doing so can't be provided.

pre.
    mkdir GLXOSD
    cd GLXOSD
    git clone -b v3 --recursive https://github.com/nickguletskii/GLXOSD source
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../source
    make all
    make install
